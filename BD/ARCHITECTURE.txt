PHP Page deposit.

Most interfaces will follow some simple rules:
- M(S)VC architecture : It's basically MVC with a service layer to keep objects serializable. Else they don't fit in session variables.
- One interface, one purpose : Avoid interfaces merging a lot of unrelated functionalities. If an interface manages user's information, it does just that...
- Keep the views simple : Avoid fancy views that are intuitive only to half the people using the web site.


In addition, most pages will follow this base structure:
