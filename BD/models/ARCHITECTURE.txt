This is the Model Layer.

All classes here should be serializable and able to be kept in the user's session.
There should not be any direct reference to data mappers or any SQL in these, as it will lead to the necessity of having a link to the PDO.
The PDO is *not* serializable : keep away from it!

What's the PDO?
---------------
It's the interface between PHP and your database. It defines a series of classes that implement easy communication and data recovery through SQL queries.
